# Java Articles Idea

## Made a discovery

#############
### Interface Discovery
- once you made a class to implement an interface,
by default all method in the implementing class
becomes inaccessible to other class if not
explicitly defined in the interface class
as "public"
- I don't know if it same for abstract 
classes which partial abstraction\

## Java PriorityQueue
- PriorityQueue is a part of Java's collections framework.
- PriorityQueue does not prioritize literaly without the help of poll.
- that means the effect of PriorityQueue only takes effect when you use .poll to pull element from the queue. else the arrangement of the element is not guranted even with the implementation of Comparator, if you are to traverse throught the PriorityQueue literaly or using an Iterator interface. 

## Consumer, Supplier and Function Interface.
- Consumer interface is used to perform an action on an object.
Consumer<T, U> are parameter types
- Supplier interface is used to generate a result.
Supplier<T, U> are return type
- Function interface is used to perform an action on an object and return a result.
Function<T, U> are parameter and return type respectively.

## Article idea.
### The difference in syntax between java version 8 and java version 21.
- The article will highlight the differences in syntax between java version 8 and java version 21.
- It will also highlight the new features introduced in java version 21.
- The article will also provide examples of how to use the new features.
- The article will also provide a comparison of the performance of the two versions.
- The article will also provide a conclusion on which version is better to use.
